## Markdown Basic Syntax
  - Headings
    - The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level
    - You can use up to six number signs to create a heading 
    - The more number signs gives you a smaller heading and a lower number of number signs will give you a larger heading size
      
          *Examples* 
            # heading = heading level 1
            ###### heading  = heading level 6
            
  - Paragraphs
  >Tabs and whitespace have a special meaning in Markdown. 
   You can use trailing whitespace to create line breaks, and you can use tabs to create code blocks. 
   But what if you need to indent a paragraph the old-fashioned way, using the tab key? Markdown doesnâ€™t provide an easy way of doing that.
