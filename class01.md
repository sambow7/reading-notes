## Growth Mindset

>To me "growth mindset" means taking on a mindset to push through things that might be challenging or seem difficult at first glance. In another words it's teaching yourself to love learning and not letting the fear hold you back. 


## Three "growth mindset" reminders

> 1. Remind myself growth is a process, not a destinaion. 
>    - Setting small goals inside a big goal will help keep the process going. 
> 2. Don't avoid obsticales 
>    - Viewing obstacles as opportunities instead of struggles provides a healthy mindset for growth
> 3. Embrace fa ilure
>    - Learning to be ok with failure and not avoiding failure helps you learn from the failure and provides an oppurtunity for growth.
