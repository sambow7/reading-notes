## **Intro**
  
  > Hello everyone. My name is Sam and I am new to software development. I currently live in Seattle and have been for the last 20 years. When I'm not playing video games or practicing code I like to get outside and enjoy being in the beautiful nature that sorrounds me in Washington.
