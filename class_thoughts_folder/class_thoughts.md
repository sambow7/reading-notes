**Thoughts**

> My thoughts so far using markdown, GitHub, Git, Remo, terminal, Slack, Canvas, and VS code is they can be a bit of a challenge and can be daunting at first, but once you have them setup things begin to repeat and the workflow becomes easier. One of the first things covered in this class was getting your mindset right before you face some of these learning challenges. I gained from this the ability to remind myself of negative thoughts and to not avoid but embrace challenges. (2/14/23)

Markdown: 

> Markdown is a plain text formating syntax. This beginning syntax has been fun to learn since it's so forgiving and easy to play with while you learn what the syntax puts out.  (12/14/23)

Text Editor:

> Choosing a text editor seems to be a mix of your level of programing or project and personal preference. I like Visual Studio Code so far. It seems to work well with my operating system and has some great themes to make things stand out. Just like all the new tools I have downloaded in this class they all have lots of functions that seem to help simplify and make workflow easier.
