## Growth Mindset

>To me "growth mindset" means taking on a mindset to push through things that might be challenging or seem difficult at first glance. In another words it's teaching yourself to love learning and not letting the fear. 


## Three "growth mindset" reminders

> 1. Remind myself growth is a process, not a destinaion. 
>    - Setting small goals inside a big goal will help keep the process going. 
> 2. Don't avoid obsticales 
>    - Viewing obstacles as opportunities instead of struggles provides a healthy mindset for growth
> 3. Embrace fa ilure
>    - Learning to be ok with failure and not avoiding failure helps you learn from the failure and provides an oppurtunity for growth.
