### *Choosing A Text Editor*
                        
> Choosing a text editor can be a very personal preference. 
> I belive a good text editor is one that you feel comfortable using and feels intuitive to you. One that helps you work smarter and more efficiently.  
> 
> Many text editors have several features but knowing what works for you is key. Take for example, if you're a visual learner maybe utilizing the different color *syntax highlighting* to help see the code would be beneficial. Some features seem universal like *code completion*. Starting with a basic text editor that comes with your coomputer is a great way to start wrapping your mind around how to code, what it looks like, basic syntax etc. Once you are familar with writing out basic HTML it is good to switch to a editor that has more features. One that works with your OS and comes with some of the common faetures you can find in all text editors. As you get better at coding youll take on bigger challenges and your editor can grwo and add extensions so you can tackle bigger projects.
> 
> There are also IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) and it's software that helps do alot of things for you in one system. A few of the things like debugging, compiling is not something you will be needing however in the future it might be something you use. An IDE might be a more than you need as a beginner but there is no real wrong answer in chosing an editor as to finding one that works well for you and the projects you are trying to tackle.
