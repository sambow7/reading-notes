## Markdown Basic Syntax
  - Headings
    - The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level.
    - You can use up to six number signs to create a heading. 
    - The more number signs gives you a smaller heading and a lower number of number signs will give you a larger heading size.
      
         *Examples* :
            
            # heading = heading level 1
            ###### heading  = heading level 6
  
  >Tabs and whitespace have a special meaning in Markdown. 
   You can use trailing whitespace to create line breaks, and you can use tabs to create code blocks. 
   But what if you need to indent a paragraph the old-fashioned way, using the tab key? Markdown doesnâ€™t provide an easy way of doing that.
  
  - Paragraphs
    - Unless the paragraph is in a list do not indent with spaces or tab.
    - Use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

         *Example* :
                
                Don't:     Keep ypur text aligned instead of 
                       indented is a better practice. Create line breaks for a paragraph break.
                
                Do: Keep ypur text aligned instead of 
                    indented is a better practice.
                    
                    Create line breaks for a paragraph break.
                    
   - Empahsis
      - You can add epmasis on words by using one, two or three asterisks or underscroes
      - To italicize or bold a letter in the middle of the word use asterisks and no spaces.
           >  *italic * = _italic_

           > **bold ** = __bold__
             
           *Example* :
            
            *italic* = _Italic_ 
            
            **bold** = __bold__
            
            
   - Block quotes 
      - To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
              
           *Example* :
            
            > this would be your paragraph. 
          
          *Example* :
          
           > this would be your paragraph
       - Blockquotes can be layered or nested by adding >> in front of the paragraph.
   
   
    
  - Lists
    - Lists can be ordered or unordered list and you can add elements.
    - You can use numbers or characters to make a list.
     
        *Example* :
        
       
         
           Ordered 
           
            1.notes. = 1.notes
            2.notes. = 2.notes
            3.notes. = 3.notes

            or...
           
         ( ' = code block)
         > Unordered      
         >  - notes =  '- notes
         >  * notes =  '* notes
         >  + notes =  '+ notes
   
   - Links
    - When creating a link make sure to enclose the kkink text in brackets followed by a URL in parenthesis
    - To turna URL or an email quicly into a link without a title or name you can enclose it with angle brackets 

         *Example* :
         
          A good search engine is [Google](https://google.com).
          
          or
          
          <https://google.com>
