### Javascaript

+ Use the console?

+ debugging = finding problems in your code and fixing.

+ Turns website into applications (interative).

+ Boolean expressions?

+ Conditional statements?

+ loops?

+ Variables - different ways to declare them:

  + var - old way
  + (none)

  + let - can be changed
  + const - constant, can NOT be changed

  + Javascript is primarly used to interact with webpages. (user input - Output)

  +

+ [Javascrit reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)

+ [Javascript guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

+ 3 major parts of what we usually refer to as "Javascript"
  
  + The language itself. This is fairly standard among the various environments, both in the various browsers and in the various server-side environments.
  
  + The DOM API - how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser. While in this respect the various browsers are getting closer to each other they still differ. Several libraries, most prominently JQuery, is trying to provide a unified API.
  
  + The server API (or just API) provided by Node.js or one of the other server-side systems.

+ Variables are containers for storing values.

+ All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names = __identifiers__

+ Javascript __identifiers__ are case-sensitive.

+ (=) is an "__assignment__" operator, not, an "equal to" operator.

+ (==) is the "equal to" in Javascript

+ Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "__declaring__" a variable.

+ You __declare__ a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword

+ It's a good programming practice to __declare__ all variables at the beginning of a script.

### How Does a Computer Work?

+ [How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-)

+ 4 major tasks computers do what it does

  1. __Input__ - keyboards, mouse, touchscreen, microphone, camera, and wearable technology

  2. __Storage__ - information is stored for proccessing

  3. __Processing__ - uses information from memory then changes or munipulates that information with an algorithim.

  4. __Output__ - text, photos, videos, games, VR, robots, input for another computer.

## lab06 notes

+ Data types

  + Boolean - true/false

  + Strings - "words wrapped in quotes"

  + Number/Intergers - 10, 50, no quotes

+ Javascript operates in heirarchy (top to bottom)

+ make a file with .js in your VScode to attach it to your HTML.

+ link your Javascript in HTML with

      <script src="file.js"></script>
